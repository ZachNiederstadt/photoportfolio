				<p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
					Hello! I'm Zach Niederstadt, a passionate photographer based in
					Weston-super-mare, with only under a year or two of experience. My
					journey into photography began with a deep admiration for the
					incredible images others created, sparking my curiosity and driving me
					to explore this art form.
				</p>
				<p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
					One moment in my journey was when I had the opportunity to borrow
					someone else's camera. It opened up a new world for me, allowing me to
					create my own images and develop my style. Since then, I've immersed
					myself in various genres, from landscape photography to documenting
					events and capturing sports.
				</p>
				<p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
					While I don't follow a strict approach to photography, I find joy in
					the spontaneity and diversity of shooting events. It's thrilling to
					interact with different people and capture their emotions and
					interactions, creating a different story with every image.
				</p>
				<p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
					Besides photography, music is another passion of mine. The thought of
					drumming brings me immense joy as an outlet outside of my other
					hobbies.
				</p>
				<p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
					Thank you for visiting my website :D
